          I’m Deche Ammar Aissa, the lead developer and founder of E-Rynek. With
          4 years of experience in web development, specializing in Angular,
          TypeScript (TS), RxJS, and modern JavaScript (JS), I’ve dedicated
          myself to crafting innovative, user-centric solutions. My expertise,
          combined with my current studies as a first-year computer science
          student at Kielce University of Technology in Poland, fuels my work on
          E-Rynek.

          My journey in development began 4 years ago, where I honed my skills
          in building dynamic, responsive applications. This experience inspired
          me to create E-Rynek, tackling challenges like complex integrations
          and user experience optimization. As the sole developer, I manage
          every aspect of the platform, from coding with Tailwind CSS for sleek
          designs to ensuring smooth functionality, all while balancing my
          studies.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-600">
          My skills include Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, Tailwind CSS, and
          JavaScript, with a strong focus on creating efficient, scalable
          applications. You can connect with me on
